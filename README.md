# Multiclass-logistric-regression

Suprisingly there are not many explanations available when it comes to multiclass logistic regression how to implement it efficently. 

I tried two different datasets and run with library multiclass logistic regression and one I made it from scratch

I found this blog to be very helpful. 

[Sophia Yang Multiclass source code with explanation](https://sophiamyang.github.io/DS/optimization/multiclass-logistic/multiclass-logistic.html).
